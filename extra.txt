Elucidations: 
iWhen the legs of an angle are produced or prolonged betond its vertex, the
angles made by them on both ides of the vertex are said to be
\textit{vertically opposite} to each other: Thus the red and tellow angles are said to be vertically opposite angles. 

\textit{Superposition} is the process by which one magnitude may be conceived
to be placed upon another, so as exavtly to cover it, or so that every part os
each shall exactly coincide. 

A line is said to be \textit{produced}, when it is extended, prolonger, or has
its length increased, and the increase of length which it receives is called
its \textit{produced part}, or its \textit{protrusion}.
